# Product Suite
 Product is a suite of skins for Rainmeter that feature a minimalist aesthetic and the Google Product Sans font. The goal is to create something that looks great in front of any background and isn't too obstructive, while being informative and convenient.

## How can I get it?

You can download releases of Product from the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/CyberGen49/Product/releases), or pull the repository into your Rainmeter folder through [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

Note that pulling the repo directly could lead to unforeseen consequences due to the fact that you're downloading the most current developmental version of the skin, with every bug I've yet to fix.

## More Info

This skin is still in development, so there isn't much more to show. 

If you want to follow the skin's development, I'll be covering each step I take in my Discord server, which you can join by clicking [here](https://discordapp.com/invite/72GZGN3).

You can also [check out my website](https://rainmeter.simplecyber.ml/) to learn about the other things I've done.
